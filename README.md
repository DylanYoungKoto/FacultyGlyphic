## Faculty Glyphic

Faculty Glyphic is a typeface that captures the essence of Faculty, a global leader in applied AI. Designed at Koto London in 2024, it reflects London’s rich history and innovative legacy in computing, drawing inspiration from carved typography and the works of Berthold Wolpe and Edward Johnston.

This typeface is a modern tribute to Wolpe's iconic Albertus, which appears on the street signs of the City of London, becoming a defining symbol of the City’s identity post World War II.

By marrying timeless design with contemporary digital optimization, Faculty Glyphic pays homage to its home city while seamlessly merging tradition and modernity.
